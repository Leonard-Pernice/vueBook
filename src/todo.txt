System
  x create button to upload chapter in json format
    x adapt the function to account for kill syntax and other events:
      o introduce character/player
      o include "times" functionality for multi kills, multi skill usage etc.
      o delete visiblity changes... those are stupid anyway. Right?
    x create the jsons for the initialization of kale's character -> this should be inside the chapter html / json
      o initialize monster?
      o initialize paragon
      o initialize pact
  o create session info to load last state when user logs in and such
    o create function inside the respective view to post this chapter to django
  x create django models and serializers for all the character variables, quests, npcs, etc.
    o stats
      o implement stat maximum percentile
      o create models for "human", "elf", male, female, etc.
    o paragon stuff
    o pact stuff
    o etc.
  o create post methods to import chapters
    o create post methods to create new 
      o adapt CRUD structure to all of these (get List, post create, put update, delete) + their URL patterns
        o differentiate
          o real updates (creation of new entries) and 
          o meta updates (changing data of existing entries) => adjust functions to update full entry
      o create vue templates and components that list these for easy overview and implement buttons to dynamically call changes
        o components should include input fields for all the relevant information (e.g. character: name, age, gender, etc.)
  o create django view to export a list of all chapters to link them to the navigation menu via v-for
  o create functions in loaded() method or whatever it is to jump back to last position after switch
  o EVENT LOADING
    o whenever an event is scrolled past, the function just goes through all the end points in the chapter JSON and loads the ones closest to the respective referenceToLastRelevantEvent
    o the topnav should be hidden after a dynamic distance value dependent on the users screen size, not a flat value
  o think about mobile implementations?
  o create loading icon for signaling when page is still loading
    o scrolling animation to last pos when loading is done
  o hide scrollbar in mobile view
  o (maybe not) change all the views to components => keepalive + dynamic components via :is=""
  o get the chapter selection navigation bar working
  o create buttons for prev and next chapter
  o create component for chapter loading
  o create landing page
  o create settings page / menu
  o implement darkmode?
    o change from dark background (game world) to white background (real world)
  o login token and such should probably go into cookies, but I've no clue how to make that secure with httponly=true...
